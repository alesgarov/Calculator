# Calculator
As my first repo I decided to create a simple calculator. Daily used tool and best friend of math lovers. 
# üßÆ Simple Calculator in Python

Welcome to my very first GitHub project! This is a **Simple Calculator** built with **Python** to demonstrate my love for **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. While the calculator is basic in functionality, it's the result of countless hours of learning, experimenting, and, most importantly, enjoying the beauty of logic and numbers.

## üìö About This Project

As a first-year Computer Science student, I wanted my first GitHub repository to represent something meaningful. I chose to build a calculator not just because it's a classic beginner project, but because it combines two of my biggest passions: **coding** and **math**.

This project helped me:
- Practice my programming fundamentals in Python
- Understand how arithmetic operations work behind the scenes
- Explore user input, functions, and control flow
- Learn Git, GitHub, and project structure
- Build confidence through creation

## üöÄ Features

- ‚ûï Addition  
- ‚ûñ Subtraction  
- ‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication  
- ‚ûó Division  
- ‚úÖ Error handling (e.g., divide by zero)  
- üîÅ Looping functionality for continuous calculations  

## üí° Why a Calculator?

> ‚ÄúDo not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Albert Einstein*

Math has always fascinated me. It‚Äôs structured, logical, and beautiful. Programming, in many ways, is just math in motion. Building a calculator gave me the chance to blend both worlds in a simple but meaningful project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code / any text editor
- **Platform**: Command-line / Terminal

## üß† What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to work with Python functions and control flow
- Validating user input
- Gracefully handling errors
- Organizing my code and keeping it readable
- How to document and share a project through GitHub

## üìé How to Run This Project
